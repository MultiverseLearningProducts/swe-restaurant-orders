# Restaurant Orders

The idea of this piece of work is to get familiar with the wiring from database -> to models -> to server -> to templates -> to browser. The empasis here is only on displaying data. Use a seed script to populate the database. Learners will:

* Create their own data models
* Create a custom ORM using Sqlite3
* Standup an express server
* Use the handlebars templating language (keep practicing semantic HTML)
* Render data in templates
* Style a card component using dynamic data

## Routes

Try to create the following:

* `/` a page that lists all the restaurants
* `/restaurant/1` a page dedicated to a single restaurant should display menus with items
* create the dynamic hrefs to nagivate the site
